# RubikCubeSimulator

This program is an Object Oriented Representation of 3 x 3 Rubik's cube. It has classes, RubikCube, RubikCubeRow, and RubikCubeCell that interacts with each other
in an interesting fashion as they are turned in different directions. For this program, I have implemented the most basic <b>Exhaustive Search</b> method to simulate a simple program. You may implement any
other algorithms in this basic Rubik's Cube framework.
